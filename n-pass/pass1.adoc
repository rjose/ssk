= Pass 1: Create a base docker image

Create a docker image that's suitable for running all of the ssk
nodes.

Every node will have the same runit entry point. Different nodes will
set up different services. However, all previous services will be
inherited.

The image can be built from the toplevel Makefile.

During development, all containers will be able to be run from the
toplevel Makefile. For service development, release directories will
be mounted dynamically into an image.

== Tasks
- [x] Copy initial base Dockerfile from previous ssk attempt
- [x] Set up toplevel Makefile
- [x] Organize top level makefile
- [x] Format help message

== Status
Effort spent: 2.3h
Effort left: 0.5h
Initial estimate: 4 hours

== Log

** 05:25 Start Pass 1
Let's start Pass 1. We'll create a base Docker file. I want to be able
to do everything from the top level, though. We'll have top level
Makefile to coordinate everything.

** 05:42 >> Copy the initial Dockerfile over

** 05:48 (6 min) Have initial dockerfile
Not sure if I should install erlang-base or just go with elixir. Let's
comment everything out and see create a base image from the toplevel
Makefile. From there I will experiment.

** 06:00 (18 min) Can run image from Makefile
Let's install elixir and see if it runs.

** 06:11 (29 min) Add make target to remove all docker images
I ran into an issue where apt-get update wasn't being run because an
intermediate image was already there. I was about to do this manually
when I decided to just put this into a Makefile.

** 06:27 (45 min) Couldn't find elixir
Let's try debian 7.8 instead of 8.0. Yes, that worked.

** 06:34 (52 min) << Let's take a break
After the break, I'll install runit and syslog
